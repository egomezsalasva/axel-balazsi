                    <h3>Artist Statement</h3>
                    <p>Axel Balazsi is preoccupied with how the notion of design on a material, conceptual, and ideological level, governs our daily lives. His work taps into visual communication, infrastructural systems, industrial design, to explore a state where an everyday object travels between industrial and domestic realms; from when it is produced and displayed to finally become a part of your everyday life. It is a space of in-between detachment and attachment, where desire and speculation come into play. His work evokes the question if everyday objects could be viewed as cultural artefacts communicating beyond its functionality.</p>
                    <p>His installations formulate abstract narratives of how form follows function up to a certain point, and then the objects deviate from its functionality. It reflects upon the process of how we transfer ideas into a material world. The work becomes a game of seducing the viewer into deceiving distorted ideas. It creates a form of riddle for the viewer, where the answer is not obvious yet present within the work.</p>
